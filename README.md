# „A portable module for performing Man-In-The-Middle attacks” #

It's my engineering thesis project in which I automate my RaspberryPI to harvesting credentials from open WLANs.
At this time, i can only harvest from HTTP, but my goal is to steal passwords from HTTPS :).

RaspberryPI should be cable free:
  -configuration via SSH
  -power supply from powerbank

Most of scripts have not been code optimized yet.
On master branch is bettercap v1.6.2 - very old one, still works, but easy to detect and slow down network to death.
